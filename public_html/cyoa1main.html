<h1>Somewhere far from home...</h1>

<div class = "left">

	<p> You awake on a surface of cold stone, the frigid air cruelly gnawing at your exposed flesh as a dim light shines down on you from somewhere above inthe distance. 
		Groggily you sit up on the edge of the slab and look around. There is a compass at your feet which you take. To the east there is a wooden door, slightly ajar, and
		at the foot of your former resting place there is a small wooden chest, it's elaborate bronze fittings glimmer in the otherwise dismal room. It would stand out in a 
		crowded warehouse. But in this miserable, dingy room it isn't possible for it to feel more out of place.
