<h3><a name="biography">About Me</a></h3>
	<p>	On a Friday, around noontime as snow covered the ground in a fine white layer Alexander, or Alex as everyone calls him was born. After an almost completely normal and uneventful childhood he moved on to study
		Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology at A level before applying to the <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk">University of Liverpool</a> to study physics. Making it in he embarked upon a four year course, stopping 
		only to catch his breath when his lungs collapsed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Soldiering on through University through the winter and surgery through the summer he eventually wavered and deferred his study for a year, searching for less
		strenuous work and filling up the rest of his time with voluntary work. It was in this year that he learnt some very rudimentary programming, though little could come from it, as it was soon time to return and finish
		his degree. 
	</p>
	<p>
		He came back to the third year, with no intention of attempting the fourth, he would do his dissertation here and now and be done with exams and assignments once and for all. From his free time away from 
		complicated math problems he continued with a little programming, slowly developing a taste for it. After a meeting with the careers department he had made up his mind, if it was feasible then he would try 
		and get a job as a software developer, he would learn on the job the subtelties of programming. 
	</p>	
	<p>
		Unfortunately this wasn't to be, a lacklustre degree specification with a bare CV will do that. And after a great deal of searching and only a single unpaid shift as a kitchen porter to show for it Alex decided to
		return to school, a masters degree with an actually good mark would be taken seriously, more seriously than a bunch of half finished projects and participation in a solitary Gamejam. And so here he is now; 
		writing this webpage to the best of his abilities. Determined to do more than just pass.
