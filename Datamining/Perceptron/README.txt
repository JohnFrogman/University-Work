One can run the perceptron in the terminal window by navigating to the directory 
in which it is located and enter "python Perceptron.py"

Both the test and train data must be placed in the same folder as the python 
script otherwise the program will not run.

All of the data gathered can be seen in the terminal window once run, however the
accuracy of the algorithm is different in each run so one should not expect to 
obtain the exact same results that have been recorded in the accuracy graph.

To change the number of iterations that the perceptron runs for you can change the 
iterations variable at line 90 to the desired number of iterations.

To change the files used in the program you can change the file names for the 
negative train data, the negative test data, the positive train data and the 
positive test data at lines 96, 97, 98 and 99 respectively.
