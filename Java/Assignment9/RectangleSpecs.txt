//												RectangleSpecs: Instructions														//
//																																	//
// The first two lines should contain the height then width of the area to be drawn on, the next two contain the x then y  			//
// coordinate of the top left corner of the rectangle to be drawn. The two following lines will contain the coordinates of the 		//
// bottom right corner of the triangle then on the line that follows is the character that the rectangle will be drawn with. The  	//
// program will stop drawing rectangles when it sees a negative number rather than a new top left X coordinate. The origin begins 	//
// at (0,0) and in this example the maximum (x,y) is (9,9). You are setting the height and width not the maximum X and Y. The Y  	//
// axis is inverted from a normal graph, an increase in Y will move the point downwards. The below is an example of a valid input	//
// consisting of two overlapping rectangles. I have also provided the output that that this input will produce in rectangles.txt	//																						//
// 																																	//
//								The program will begin drawing at the first number it detects.										//
